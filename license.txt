Prisma is a comprehensive software package to perform computational analysis of physical problems
on the macro scale level that couples many fields. It focuses on the ease of usability, backward compatibility and aim to lower the barrier for entry user. Furthermore, the scripting interface
with both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported. It is compilable and runnable on Android systems.

Prisma comprises of two primary components, namely the kernel and the extensions (applications).
The kernel of Prisma is adopted and modifed from Kratos Multi-Physics. On the extension part,
Prisma develops its own applications. It is noted that Prisma does not use any applications developed
in Kratos Multi-Physics package and hence Prisma's applications will not be interoperable with
Kratos Multi-Physics applications.

The license of the kernel for PM can be found in kratos/license.txt.
Individual license for each application can be found in the corresponding directory.
